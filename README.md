The **MINLAM** package provides the *fuss_PARALLEL()* function to address Bayesian probabilty estimation for categorical multimodal 
data depending on a prior density estimation. Main functionality of **MINLAM** is to provide subpopulation detection and data probabilty
belonging to these subpopulations. It is based on the Metrolpolitan-Hastings sampling written by Virgilio Gómez-Rubio for internal integration 
within the **INLA** package.
